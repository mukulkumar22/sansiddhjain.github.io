## Hi there!

I am a 4th year Dual Degree Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, majoring in Computer Science & Mechanical Engineering. 

Here you can find a more detailed summary of some of my projects, and some of my coursework.

Oh, and apart from engineering, I am an avid reader, with a particular soft spot for The Caravan Magazine, The Guardian's Long Read, and Asterix Comics. I have recently taken to running for recreation, and I try my best to do it regularly, despite Delhi's atmosphere's evil plans to stop me from doing so. Along with it has the habit of telling people to [stop eating so much sugar](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html). 

When I am free, I like to root for the Cavs, despite knowing about their abysmal understanding of the word 'defense'; I like to idolise Roger Federer, because he's God's answer to the question, 'What is the closest thing to a perfect human being?'; I like to watch Denis Villeneuve movies, and I do not like to watch Michael Bay movies.
