## Hello, world!

I am a final year dual degree undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, majoring in Industrial Engineering & Computer Science. 

I did my undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Mausam](http://cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/), and I recently interned at [Wadhwani AI Institute](https://wadhwaniai.org/). Both were absolutely brilliant experiences, and I ended up learning, as much as I had fun.

My undergraduate thesis dealt with analysing court cases data from Indian district courts. The job was to assimilate a massive, unprecedented dataset of court case summaries from districts all over the country; statistically analyse them for all sorts of anomalous behaviour, and develop a neat website presenting these analyes; and finally use machine learning to develop predictive models for the purpose of surveying interventionist measures.
- We developed a website to showcase our work on anomaly detection. Plase do have a look at [it](btp_website/home.html)! You can have a look at a fancier, expanded version that is under construction, [here](http://cse.iitd.ernet.in/dair/courtanalytics/). However, keep in mind that the buffering time here would make you feel as if the data is being brought in from Mars, and you probably don't wish to feel like that.

I should probably have a significantly more expanded version of my work present here, but unfortunately I have been struck by this bug that has affected (*almost*) all humans, called procrastination. I'll try to do the needful when I have (_albeit, temporarily_) recovered from it.

Apart from engineering, over the past year, I have taken to running for recreation, and I try my best to do it regularly, despite Delhi's atmosphere's evil plans to stop me from doing so. Along with it has the habit of telling people to [stop eating so much sugar](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html). I absolutely love listening to metal, [here's](https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/mar/21/whymetalfansarebrainier) a Guardian article validating my music choices!

In sports, I like to root for the Cavs, ~~despite knowing about their abysmal understanding of the word 'defense'~~ ~~EDIT : now they do!~~ EDIT : seems like they are back to their (bad?) old ways :(. Feel free to reach out to me, in case you wish to talk about anythinng AI, and anything anything.
