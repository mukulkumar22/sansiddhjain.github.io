## Hi there!

I am a 4th year Integrated Masters student at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, majoring in Industrial Engineering & Computer Science. 

Here you can find a more detailed summary of some of my projects, and some of my coursework.

- Have a look at the website we made for my [Undergraduate Thesis](btp_website/home.html)

Oh, apart from engineering, I have recently taken to running for recreation, and I try my best to do it regularly, despite Delhi's atmosphere's evil plans to stop me from doing so. Along with it has the habit of telling people to [stop eating so much sugar](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html). I absolutely love listening to metal, [here's](https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/mar/21/whymetalfansarebrainier) a Guardian article validating my music choices.

In sports, I like to root for the Cavs, ~~despite knowing about their abysmal understanding of the word 'defense'~~ ~~EDIT : now they do!~~ EDIT : seems like they are back to their (bad?) old ways :(. I like to idolise Roger Federer, because he's God's answer to the question, 'What is the closest thing to a perfect human being?'. Movies take up whatever free time that's left!
