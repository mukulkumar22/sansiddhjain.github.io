        <p>Hey you,</p>
        <p>A very very very verrryy happy birthday to you! Have an absolute blast today :') </p>
        <p>I soo wish I could be there with you. Sans-kriti will spend her birthday sans Sans-iddh :'(. </p>
        <p>I don't think you'll remember, but today is 1 day short of it being exactly 5 months since our paths crossed! November the 12th at some 23:xx, came the cute 'Heyyy' text from you, and look what that led to! These 5 months have been nothing short of magical. You're the most mesmerising thing ever, and I am so lucky to have run into you. </p>
        <p>I miss you. Come back home soooon, so that we can have celebrations v2.0!!</p>
        
        <p>PS - Since no bakery or restaurant dares to deliver to your college (*frowning emoji*), here's a little virtual cake love for you. Enjoy! :D </p>
